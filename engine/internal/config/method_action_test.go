// The method -> ladder-action mapping, pinned.

// MitigationMethod.Action is the single hop between "what the operator wrote in
// the config" and "what mechanism will actually run". Every synthesized
// single-rung ladder — global, per hostgroup, and the carpet (prefix) path in
// internal/mitigate — resolves through it.
//
// It replaced a catch-all switch whose default was blackhole. That default is
// why widening carpet.mitigation to accept "dataplane" was not a one-line
// change: the validator would have accepted the method and the mapping would
// have quietly returned "blackhole the whole aggregation prefix". These tests
// make the mapping total and keep it that way.
