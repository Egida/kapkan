// Command flowinject fabricates the traffic scene the operator-console
// screenshots are taken against, and nothing else. It is a development tool: it
// speaks the same NetFlow v9 wire format a router speaks, at kapkan's ordinary
// listener, so the engine has no idea it is being posed for a photograph.
//
// The scene is three hosts under attack on three different policy paths (a
// tight hostgroup, the same hostgroup on a different protocol, and the default
// /24 policy) plus a few quiet neighbours, so the Hosts view shows green rows
// next to the red ones instead of reading as a wall of fire.
//
// Sampling is what makes this cheap. Every packet reports a sampling rate in a
// NetFlow v9 options template, and kapkan multiplies the records it receives by
// that rate — so a few hundred fabricated records stand in for a multi-hundred-
// thousand-pps flood, and the numbers on screen are the numbers a real attack
// of that size would produce.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./scripts/flowinject -target 127.0.0.1:2055
//	go run ./scripts/flowinject -target 127.0.0.1:2055 -duration 30s -v
//
// It runs until interrupted, because the console must keep seeing fresh flows
// or the attacks it is displaying stop being ongoing.

//
// An earlier version of this comment recorded the formula as unreliable — the

// rate fivefold appeared to halve the reported pps. Neither was a sampling
// problem. /api/v1/attacks used to serve the measurement frozen at the instant
// of detection, which is the first sliding window to cross a threshold and so
// the one holding a single second of a five-second average: a fifth of the truth
// for the whole life of an attack, or a tenth when the first datagram landed
// mid-second, which is the apparent halving. It now serves the engine's live
// measurement, and the formula, /api/v1/hosts and the console all agree.
