// Command flowinject fabricates the traffic scene the operator-console
// screenshots are taken against, and nothing else. It is a development tool: it
// speaks the same NetFlow v9 wire format a router speaks, at kapkan's ordinary
// listener, so the engine has no idea it is being posed for a photograph.
//
// The scene is three hosts under attack on three different policy paths (a
// tight hostgroup, the same hostgroup on a different protocol, and the default
// /24 policy) plus a few quiet neighbours, so the Hosts view shows green rows
// next to the red ones instead of reading as a wall of fire.
//
// Sampling is what makes this cheap. Every packet reports a sampling rate in a
// NetFlow v9 options template, and kapkan multiplies the records it receives by
// that rate — so a few hundred fabricated records stand in for a multi-hundred-
// thousand-pps flood, and the numbers on screen are the numbers a real attack
// of that size would produce.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./scripts/flowinject -target 127.0.0.1:2055
//	go run ./scripts/flowinject -target 127.0.0.1:2055 -duration 30s -v
//
// It runs until interrupted, because the console must keep seeing fresh flows
// or the attacks it is displaying stop being ongoing.

// An earlier version of this comment recorded the formula as unreliable — the

// of detection, which is the first sliding window to cross a threshold and so
// the one holding a single second of a five-second average: a fifth of the truth
// for the whole life of an attack, or a tenth when the first datagram landed
// mid-second, which is the apparent halving. It now serves the engine's live
// measurement, and the formula, /api/v1/hosts and the console all agree.

// scene is deliberately hard-coded: it is matched to configs/dev.yaml, whose

// 203.0.113.0/26 (pps 20000, mbps 500, flows_per_sec 10000) and global
// thresholds at pps 80000 / udp_pps 60000. Change one and you must change the
// other.
//
// Measured at -sampling-rate 1000 -interval 500ms, ~20s in:
//
//	203.0.113.45  pps 520k vs 20k = 26×  (UDP flood, 5.8 Gbps)
//	203.0.113.10  pps 240k vs 20k = 12×  (SYN flood, 115 Mbps — packets, not bits)
//	203.0.113.77  320k, 4–5×           (DNS reflection, 3.8 Gbps)
//
// 203.0.113.77 crosses two of its thresholds — the global pps 80000 and udp_pps
// 60000 — so which one the row names varies between runs: whichever tripped first
// in the window that opened the detection. It reads 4× as pps or 5.3× as udp_pps.
// The floor in capture-console.sh is set below both.
//
// and exactly three active attacks: the quiet hosts stay under every threshold.
//
// The record counts were divided by five once /api/v1/attacks stopped serving the
// rate frozen at detection. The scene had always offered five times this, but the
// figures it was originally calibrated against were read off the frozen endpoint,
// so the numbers above are what the console had been showing all along and what
// the scene was in fact chosen to look like. Restoring them is deliberate: the
// unreduced scene put a 29 Gbps flood against a single /32 and 130× threshold on
// a public marketing page, and 130× over threshold does not read as a capable
// detector — it reads as a threshold set 130× too low. What the screenshot is
// there to show is three vectors classified apart, each with its own method and
// escalation rung; the magnitude adds nothing to that.
//
// Retuning: pps = recordsPerTick × packetsPerRecord × samplingRate / interval,
// which now matches what /api/v1/attacks, /api/v1/hosts and the console report.
// If you change these, update the floors in capture-console.sh to match.
